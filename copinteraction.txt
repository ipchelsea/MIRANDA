Hello, sir. I am Officer Tony Shales of the Houston Police Department. How are you today?
I am very well, thank you. Any problems, officer?
Yes. You seem to have run over two red lights. License and registration, please.
I absolutely did not! I did not run over any red lights whatsoever, sir. Here's my license anyway.
Sir, this does not appear to be a legitimate license. Step out of the vehicle, please.
What? It is! I was granted this driving license by the great state of Oregon! 
I am giving you to the count of 3 to step out of the vehicle. Put your hands behind your back, you are under arrest.
What are you talking about? Why won't you run my license? I'm sure you'll find a registered plate!
Sir, you have been given enough warnings and you are getting aggressive. I am going to tase you now.
